1. Data Preparation and Quality Assurance
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Ensure you have a robust data cleaning process. This includes handling missing data (e.g., interpolation or deletion), adjusting for corporate actions (splits, dividends) if necessary, and filtering out any outliers or erroneous data that could impact later calculations.

- Data Frequency Considerations:
Decide on the frequency (daily, weekly, monthly) that best suits your analysis. Rolling estimates must align with the temporal granularity, so confirm that the chosen data frequency optimally balances noise and signal.

- Data Stationarity:
Verify if the time series data (returns, volatilities) is stationary or if differencing/transformations are required. Using stationarity tests (ADF, KPSS) could also be part of your EDA.

2. Factor Construction and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Extended Feature Engineering:
Beyond simple calculations for volatility and momentum, consider incorporating other factors (e.g., liquidity measures, value, size) to enrich your predictive power.

- Rolling Window EDA:
For each rolling window, complement summary statistics with visualizations such as time series plots, autocorrelation functions, and distribution checks. This ensures you capture any time-varying dynamics or structural breaks.

- Stress Testing and Scenario Analysis:
Integrate stress tests to see how extreme market conditions affect your computed factors. This can help evaluate the stability of your models.

3. Enhanced Optimization and Parameter Estimation
- Robust Covariance Estimation:
Considering modern alternatives (e.g., shrinkage techniques like Ledoit-Wolf) when estimating Σ can help stabilize your estimates, particularly over rolling windows with limited data.

- Risk Aversion Coefficient (δ):
Experiment with the estimation or calibration of δ. Consider making δ dynamic by inferring it from historical risk–return trade-offs or using market-implied estimates.

- Scaling Factor τ:
Instead of just estimating τ from historical data, you could implement a sensitivity analysis or even a Bayesian approach to better capture its uncertainty.

4. Views (P and Q) and Machine Learning Integration
- Model Selection and Validation:
Since you intend to predict your views using machine learning models, detail a process for model selection, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning. For example, include both tree-based methods and linear models, and compare their forecasting performance for P and Q.

- Feature Selection:
Identify which predictors (macroeconomic indicators, technical factors, etc.) most impact your views. This could also involve dimensionality reduction techniques (like PCA) prior to the predictive modeling.

- Robustness Checks:
Establish error metrics and confidence intervals around your predictions for Q, and test the impact of mis-specification on the final portfolio. Consider ensemble approaches to hedge against model risk.

5. Portfolio Construction and Optimization
- Differential Evolution and Metaheuristics:
Differential evolution (DE) is a robust metaheuristic for non-convex problems, especially when the optimization landscape is irregular. Emphasize that DE can help find global optima where traditional quadratic programming may struggle. Ensure that you understand its parameters (population size, mutation factor, crossover probability) and validate its convergence for your application.

- Marchenko-Pastur Theorem for Filtering Noise:
The Marchenko-Pastur theorem is used to filter out noise from the eigenvalues of your covariance matrix. This step can help improve the robustness of portfolio optimization by “cleaning” the covariance matrix, thus leading to more reliable risk estimates.

- Transaction Costs and Rebalancing Frequency:
Model trading frictions and realistic rebalancing costs. Evaluate turnover constraints and incorporate regularization techniques to avoid excessive trading. Simulate different rebalancing frequencies in your backtests.

- Additional Metrics:
Beyond Sharpe ratio, consider including metrics like the Sortino ratio, maximum drawdown, and conditional value at risk (CVaR) to get a well-rounded performance picture.

6. Backtesting Framework and Performance Evaluation
- Backtesting Rigor:
Set up a detailed backtesting framework that includes walk-forward analysis. Validate your approach using out-of-sample testing and a rolling window strategy that realistically models execution lag and market impact.

- Benchmark Analysis:
Besides comparing to the S&P500, assess performance relative to other benchmarks or risk parity strategies to position your results within a broader context.

- Statistical Significance:
Use hypothesis testing (e.g., t-tests on performance metrics) to validate whether your strategy’s outperformance is statistically significant versus the chosen benchmarks.

- Visualization and Reporting:
Document your findings with clear visualizations (cumulative returns, drawdowns, factor exposures over time) and create a comprehensive report that can be showcased on your CV.

7. Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis
- Parameter Sensitivity:
Carefully analyze how sensitive your results are to the values of τ, δ, and the machine learning forecasts for P and Q. Running scenario analysis and Monte Carlo simulations could provide insights into the stability of your strategy.

- Stress Tests and Out-of-Sample Validation:
Consider additional robustness checks that simulate extreme market conditions or sudden shifts in volatility regimes. Also, validate your models across different historical periods, including bull and bear markets.

8. Documentation and Reproducibility
- Clear Code Documentation:
Ensure that every step is well-commented and that your code is modular. A reproducible notebook with clear documentation (and possibly version control) will enhance both academic and professional credibility.

- Automated Reporting:
If possible, automate the generation of reports that summarize performance metrics, risk measures, and parameter sensitivity analyses for each rolling window period.

- Risk Management and Ethics:
Incorporate a section discussing the assumptions, limitations, and potential pitfalls of the Black-Litterman approach. This shows a critical understanding and adds transparency to your project.
